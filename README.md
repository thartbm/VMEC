Visuo-Motor Experiment Creator: a simple GUI to create basic visuomotor rotation experiments using Matlab and Psychtoolbox. This tool was created for a course to allow 4th year kinesiology students to run their own experiment on a standard PC using a mouse. Basically it allows you to define a few tasks, which can then be run individually. It comes with a script that does some basic pre-processing so that you can go straight to data analysis. The output is in .csv files which open up in Excel, or any stats package that a student might know. The data are not lab quality (and usually the number of participants is quite low) but most effects in the literature do replicate to some extent, making this a good tool for students to learn about running experiments and about visuo-motor learning.

Here are a few short videos explaining how to use the software from within Matlab. This requires Psychtoolbox is installed:
